Monitoring NIC,CPU,HDD and RAM in an SSL offloading server, we can start 
with a little description of the roles of each these hardware could have
in such an environment.
 
-NICs		:	with regard to TCP/IP packet size and input/output 
			throughput of NICs in this scenario, NICs may face 
			bottleneck.
			(2*10Gbs=8.5GB~4.2GBinput+4.2GBoutput)

-HDDs		:       due to the lower speed of HDDs ( in compare to RAM )
			they only needed to be provisioned enough for the 
			installed OS, necessary software and virtual memory 
			(swap)file.

-CPUs		:	based on encryption methods and number of requests,
			CPU clock consumption may vary vastly and must be 
			monitored for further planning and provisioning.

-RAM		:	because the encryption and decryption operations should 
			take place in RAM, and requests of this type normally need
			around 10k memory per request to be processed, so it might
			be required replacing RAM with higher speed and capacity ones.


How to monitor and what to monitor?

There are lots of monitoring software at Enterprise level that can gather detailed 
information of these hardware. Servers proprietary monitoring softwares can also 
sometimes be handy.

Hardware Utilization percentage, Read/Write speed, Number of Concurrent connections,
Memory usage, NIC send/receive bandwidth. Sometimes an increase or decrease in one 
element in a hardware can be sign of fault or defieciency in other parts for example 
increasing HDD utilization could be sign of RAM shortage which can lead to slowing down 
processing of requests (encryption/decryption) , also affects interaction between users 
and applications with websites and servers .

Other assumptions could be made based on the specific case, for example : number of 
websites with different encryption types and length.
